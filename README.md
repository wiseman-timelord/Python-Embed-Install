# Python-Embed-Install
Status: Beta (Early and Part-Complete)

### Description
Its an installer for the package "Python 3.9 Embedded", this is the option where there is a zip, otherwise known as "manual install", except with this installer it becomes a "Semi-Automatic" process.

### Development
It seemed to install most stuff correctly for me on windows 8, though, I am still developing this currently, TBA.

### Instructions
1. Unpack the Embedded version of "Python 3.9" to the directory `C:\Users\**YourUserName**\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39` (obviously replacing "**YourUserName**" with the relevant `User Name`. 
2. Put `C:\Users\**YourUserName**\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39` on the path in the "Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environment Variables". 
3. Put, `Python_Embed_Install.bat` and `instller.py`, in `C:\Users\**YourUserName**\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39`, then run `Python_Embed_Install.bat`.
